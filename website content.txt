1. The Big Shift
For decades, end-of-life meant one thing: recycling first.
But recycling first melts away value that still exists in most batteries.
Synovra flips the order:
Revival first, recycling later.
👉 Unlock more revenue. Cut CO₂ by up to 90%. Simplify your operations.

2. Why Revival First Beats Recycling First
The Myth: Recycling first = full value
The Truth:
With Recycling First:
•	Payouts tied only to raw weight
•	You still handle logistics, sorting, staff, space
•	Usable capacity destroyed early
With Synovra (Revival First):
•	Pre-agreed, transparent payouts
•	Free, flexible pickups (on-demand or recurring)
•	Synovra handles sorting, weighing, and testing
•	Revival first delays smelting, saving up to 90% CO₂
•	Automated ESG reports
•	Zero operational burden

3. The Value on the Table
Recycling First	Revival First (Synovra)
Fixed scrap tied to lead prices	Predictable payouts + resale upside
Usable batteries destroyed	Extra value captured before recycling
Burden of sorting & space	Zero-effort pickups & testing
One revenue moment only	Two revenue moments (revival + eventual recycling)
No brand differentiation	Stronger ESG profile with verified reports

4. Proof in Action
•	20,000+ batteries successfully revived
•	95–100% capacity restored
•	1.2M+ kg CO₂ emissions avoided
•	Millions in cost savings delivered
•	10+ industries served (automotive, telecom, solar, logistics, healthcare)
👉 Across pilots worldwide, revival first consistently outperformed recycling first — financially and environmentally.
